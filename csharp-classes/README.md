# C# Classes in a Nutshell

## Introduction
In C#, classes are the building blocks of object-oriented programming (OOP). They provide a way to define and create objects that encapsulate data and behavior. This README serves as a concise guide to understanding the fundamentals of C# classes.


## Defining a Class
To define a class in C#, you use the `class` keyword followed by the class name. The class acts as a blueprint for creating objects. Here's an example of a simple class definition:

```csharp
class MyClass
{
    // Class members go here
}
```

## Creating Objects
Once you have defined a class, you can create objects (instances) of that class using the `new` keyword. Here's an example of creating an object of the `MyClass` class:

```csharp
MyClass myObject = new MyClass();
```

## Class Members
Class members are the variables, properties, methods, and constructors that belong to a class.

### Fields
Fields are variables declared within a class. They represent the state or data associated with an object. Here's an example of a class with fields:

```csharp
class MyClass
{
    public int myField; // Example field
}
```

### Properties
Properties provide a controlled way to access and modify the fields of a class. They allow encapsulation and can contain custom logic. Here's an example of a class with a property:

```csharp
class MyClass
{
    private string myField; // Example field

    public string MyProperty
    {
        get { return myField; }
        set { myField = value; }
    }
}
```

### Methods
Methods are functions defined within a class that perform specific tasks or operations. They encapsulate behavior associated with the class. Here's an example of a class with a method:

```csharp
class MyClass
{
    public void MyMethod()
    {
        // Method implementation goes here
    }
}
```

### Constructors
Constructors are special methods used to create and initialize objects of a class. They are called when an object is created. Here's an example of a class with a constructor:

```csharp
class MyClass
{
    public MyClass()
    {
        // Constructor logic goes here
    }
}
```

## Inheritance
Inheritance allows you to create new classes based on existing ones. It promotes code reuse and the creation of class hierarchies. To create a derived class (child class), you use the `:` symbol followed by the base class. Here's an example of a class inheritance:

```csharp
class MyBaseClass
{
    // Base class members
}

class MyDerivedClass : MyBaseClass
{
    // Derived class members
}
```

## Access Modifiers
Access modifiers control the visibility and accessibility of class members. There are four access modifiers in C#:

- `public`: Accessible from anywhere.
- `private`: Accessible only within the same class.
- `protected`: Accessible within the same class and derived classes.
- `internal`: Accessible within the same assembly (project).

## Static Members
Static members belong to the class itself rather than to individual objects. They are accessed using the class
