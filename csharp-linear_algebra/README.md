# Linear Algebra Library in C#

This is a basic implementation of a linear algebra library in C#. The library provides common operations and functions for working with vectors and matrices.

## Getting Started

To use this library in your C# project, follow these steps:

1. Download the library files from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/your-repository-link).
2. Add the library files to your project's directory.
3. Include the library namespace in your C# file:

```csharp
using LinearAlgebraLibrary;
```

4. Create instances of vectors and matrices using the provided classes:

```csharp
Vector v = new Vector(2, 3, 4);
Matrix m = new Matrix(new double[,] { { 1, 2 }, { 3, 4 } });
```

## Features

This library supports the following operations:

- Addition and subtraction of vectors and matrices
- Scalar multiplication and division
- Matrix multiplication
- Transpose of matrices
- Determinant of matrices
- Inverse of matrices

Refer to the library documentation for detailed usage examples and available functions.

## Examples

Here are some examples of how to use this library:

```csharp
// Addition of vectors
Vector v1 = new Vector(1, 2, 3);
Vector v2 = new Vector(4, 5, 6);
Vector sum = v1 + v2;

// Scalar multiplication of matrices
Matrix m1 = new Matrix(new double[,] { { 1, 2 }, { 3, 4 } });
double scalar = 2;
Matrix result = m1 * scalar;

// Matrix multiplication
Matrix m2 = new Matrix(new double[,] { { 1, 2, 3 }, { 4, 5, 6 } });
Matrix product = m1 * m2;

// Determinant of a matrix
Matrix squareMatrix = new Matrix(new double[,] { { 1, 2 }, { 3, 4 } });
double determinant = squareMatrix.GetDeterminant();

// Inverse of a matrix
Matrix invertibleMatrix = new Matrix(new double[,] { { 1, 2 }, { 3, 4 } });
Matrix inverse = invertibleMatrix.GetInverse();
```
